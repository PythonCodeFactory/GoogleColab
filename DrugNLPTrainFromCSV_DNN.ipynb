Some days I take higher doses of 112.5mg and 30mg. The combination has worked wonders for my condition. I started on Remeron initially and titrated to 45mg/day, but did not feel it was working for my depression, although it did help with sleep and appetite. I tried gabapentin for a while and was able to quit Remeron entirely for some time (wanted to give my receptors a break). Gabapentin was great for anxiety but made me more suicidal. I quit gabapentin and went back on just 15mg of Remeron, this time also adding the Effexor. I have been very happy with the results. It seems to be the first medication that really works for me. I had significant side effects when starting Effexor, but they subsided completely after about a week- feeling high much like MDMA, and I had diarrhea and some insomnia. When I increased from 37.5 to 75 mg, the only con I noticed was lower energy level (and some yawning). I started drinking some coffee to help with that. This is a very serious medication to be taking, as I know it can be very hard to withdraw from; however, I am committed to sticking with it. Eventually may increase my dose up to 150mg. Effexor makes me feel very mellow. I am less concerned about what people think of me. I am quite confident with the ladies. My sex life has been better than ever on this med combination. I have wondered if my sense of humor is dulled, however. I am also somewhat lazy, but this may change when I go up to a higher dose. Risk-taking behaviors should be watched when increasing the dose, as I broke my ankle playing sports. Overall, I give this medication 9/10 and am very happy that I got the script. I recommend taking it with Remeron to better manage the nighttime, and to counteract the side effects. They have a wonderful synergy. My only concern is that they may eventually stop working, and I may eventually have to stop taking them and suffer the infamous withdrawals.'\n"," b'been on it for 5 months, its awkward not having my period at all, but it&#039;s awesome to not be pregnant again.

Since I&#039;d developed treatment refractory depression, after 3 weeks with no results (and horrible side effects) I asked to be bumped up from 60mg to 90mg. After another 2 weeks, I went to 120mg.  This triggered my first hypomanic episode in my 30-something years.  Scaled back down to 60mg and what do you know, this time it worked.  Give Cymbalta a chance to work, don&#039;t rush it.

From the second month to the sixth month, I gained about twenty pounds with no significant lifestyle changes or dietary changes besides the NuvaRing. If you are tolerant of high hormone levels and don&#039;t gain weight, this might be a good option for you.

I had it placed in February and then in May I found out I had a 6cm cyst on my right ovary. I was having horrible cramping and sharp pain. After being in pain for 2 months, the symptoms finally started to go away. My doctors said that it was probably just a coincidence and that Skyla does not cause cysts. Unfortunately I just found out I have another large cyst on my left ovary, so I had the IUD removed. Prior to having skyla placed, I had never had an issue with ovarian cysts. I would NOT recommend this birth control if you think there could be a possibility that you are at a higher risk of cysts!'\n"," b'I got my Implanon in June of 09... I love it!

The procedure was a piece of cake and was no more than 10 minutes. the pain was only slight cramping for few seconds while inserting. The  first few days I had cramps which is typical, but they were bearable. I had light spotting for about a month after which was annoying, but that has now stopped. So far I&#039;ve only had 1 period and it was super light and lasted two days which is not typical for me. I usually have a heavy perioid (super tampon) for a week.

Unfortunately it was just not the drug for me. I had terrible nausea that never went away, as well as vomiting. Brintellix didn&#039;t really do anything for my anxiety, either, and I definitely noticed symptoms of that again. By the time I stopped taking it, my depression was actually worse, but I think it didn&#039;t help that I was feeling so bad physically.

I&#039;m 5&#039;5 and weigh 115-120 my weight sometimes it fluctuates 5 pounds or so but I never had any major weight gain taking this medicine. I went off of it a year ago for a few months... my skin got soooo mad at me!! I had awful acne on my jaw line - my doctor told me it was hormonally related. Once I went back on it my skin cleared up, my cramps were gone and my period was light and lasted about 3-4 days. It&#039;s been a wonderful solution for issues encountered during my period.'\n"," b'I have had the Implanon for about 12 weeks and am going to have it removed next week.  Although a good form of contraception for preventing babies, I have found it made me moody, anxious and at times down-right depressed.  Also sometimes aggressive, and my libido dwindled to nothing (rather defeats the object).  My poor young boys think an alien has inhabited their Mummy&#039;s body, and they are the final reason I am having it taken out.  I have been irritable beyond belief with them and never was before this went in.  My husband wants his wife back, my kids want their mum back and I want my life back.  It works for some people.  It has not worked for me.'\n"," b'I have been on xulane for 3 months now and I love it. Before I started my periods were bad with headaches, cramping, and heavy flow, after the first month my periods dwindled and now I only need light pads, I rarely cramp and have maybe one headache. However I do get some redness and irritation on my skin, trouble with the patch adhering to my skin and also my eating habits have changed dramatically, sometimes I&#039;ll be starving and when I see what I&#039;m about to eat I lose any urge to eat.

I ended up bleeding for a whole 3 months which defeated the purpose of getting it for birth control because I couldn&#039;t have sex anyways because of it. I got a second shot in August and the bleeding stopped but I started getting headaches and feeling dizzy frequently. My next shot is scheduled for October but I refuse to get another after reading other women&#039;s reviews and horror stories. The side effects are insane and not worth the risk. I would never recommend the shot to anyone.'\n"," b'I have had a Mirena for a little over a month now. I was very scared about it after reading negative stories online.  However, my experience with Mirena has been mostly positive.  This past month I have had off and on light bleeding, my actual period lasted a couple days and was way lighter than I am used to.  My acne has improved a great deal (which is a huge positive).  My partner can&#039;t feel the strings. I did experience some occasional cramps, especially the first couple days after insertion (For Your Information insertion pain was minimal).

I took it to help lighten my periods and was on it for about 9 months. Though it did help with my periods, I just didn&#039;t like the woman I became on it. I then switched to the patch and experienced the same thing. Next was the Depo shot. Ladies beware! To follow were 3 months of complete hell. My mood was constantly up and down and just about anything could send me into hysterics. Refusing to continue with the shot I asked my doctor for a low hormone birth control and she suggested Lutera. It&#039;s been 5 months now and I couldn&#039;t be more satisfied. My skin is clear, I went from a B to a D cup, and best of all, no mood swings! I am so happy with this pill. I 100% recommend it.'\n"," b'My Doctor is bad and suggested this medicine. I&#039;ve tried lots of different ones nothing has helped in 10 yrs.

I&#039;ve been a nervous wreak for 36 hrs.  I woke up with a terrible  right side headache, muscle ache in my jaw or my right eye, feeling sick to my stomach.

Very effective at preventing pregnancy. However, I have terrible mood swings, migraines, and weight gain. When I started taking Depo I was the healthiest I have ever been. Slowly but surely I put on the pounds and my depression became unbearable! The first year I didn&#039;t gain much, maybe ten pounds and went from a size 4 to a size 6.

It is not for everyone of course but you can not know unless you try it. I did not feel the needle go in my arm, they numbed it and that was the only thing I felt. There are times that I forget I have it. You do not notice it after a few days of having it. It is a really great method, you do not have to take something every day or put something in every month, it stays in for 3 years and once they remove it you can have another added the same day.

On Paxil I just couldn&#039;t lose weight and my insurance wanted me to try an SRNI before they would pay for the newer meds like Brintellix. At first I noticed a decrease in anxiety THEN I went to work!! My job is very stressful and I have to be SPOT on!! First I noticed anxiety returning then that I was clumsy..dropping things! I then started noticing numbness and tingling in my fingers and then waking up with numb arms which would not wake up for up to 7hrs!!! I did some research and noticed that numbness/tingling of the extremities is a side effect for 20% of people taking Effexor. The numbness scared me to death! I immediately went to my Shrink and got off this damn drug! I&#039;m going to Lexapro! Ugh!'\n"," b'I have been on Alesse 28 for a year now as of this upcoming March. Big improvement over my other pill Ministerin 24. Before I took Aleese, I had irregular periods with lots of blood on the 2nd day. After switching to Alesse, my periods are only 4 days and I have no spotting compared to my other pill. I recommend this pill to any women but talk to your gynacologist first as it is not for everyone. Also, I have no acne! :)'\n"," b'I was on this pill for a little more than one year before I switched to an IUD (mirena)\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nPros:\\r\\r\\n-regular, short, predictable periods with little to no PMS\\r\\r\\n-clear skin\\r\\r\\n-went up a cup size (B to C)\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nCons:\\r\\r\\n-increased vaginal discharge and odor\\r\\r\\n-weight gain (20lbs) with little to no change in diet/exercise \\r\\r\\n-moodiness/days of low energy \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nI might have stayed on this pill because of the regular periods and clear acne, but the weight gain made me self conscious and a break from daily pills (with IUD) was appealing.'\n"," b'Lo-Seasonique is a good birth control, and awesome to not have a period for 3 months. I had stopped taking birth control for a year because of migraines, they improved and then worsened again. MD put me on Lo-Seasonique. Initially I had breakthrough bleeding, had never had problems before. I read up on it, and to all of you that have problems, change the time you are taking the pill and take it with/after food and/or something acidic (orange juice). The reason for a lot of breakthrough is high estrogen not being absorbed. Otherwise I have had minor cramping periodically if I miss ONE pill. I do notice a drop in sex drive, and just heavy feeling. But minor changes. Otherwise now almost a year on it, it&#039;s awesome.'\n"," b'I only took this medication for the first month, but I refuse to continue with it. The first week everything was fine, but over the course of two weeks I&#039;ve had extreme mood swings that just kept progressing to the point that I couldn&#039;t stand to be near my two year old. Every little thing she did set me off and that terrifies me because I&#039;ve always had so much patience with her. I was having horrible vivid dreams and the last day I was on it I had been having suicidal ideations. I&#039;d rather just risk getting pregnant than to risk feeling like that ever again.'\n"," b'I just started 2 months ago I&#039;m entering my 3rd month today but I can say that it&#039;s going okay so far considering that I have tried other birth control and they were awful but so far my two periods have been light between 2-3 days light cramping so that a plus I also feel more tired been sleeping extra hours but the birth control seems to be working in going to keep trying it and see how it keeps working . And about acne before I started this birth control I had blackheads , whitehead and I would get a few pimples it hasn&#039;t changed much some days I notice my face looks cleaner with less acne than others but I never really have had a lot of acne .'\n"," b'The first month I had it in I was supposed to start my period but I didn&#039;t start it til two weeks later it lasted about a week then spotting for a few days after that; since then I have not had a period. I like that I don&#039;t have to worry about a period at all. I am 5&#039;1 and started weight 130 when I started right now I weigh 133, I did go up to 148 but that was due to a medical issue completely apart, after being treated I am going back to my usual weight. I did actually lose a bit a weight the first few months while on it. I will say the annoying part is minor fatty parts I cannot seem to get rid of, that being my arms and upper back/hormonal weight? I have since gone Vegan and exercise a bit more too.'\n"," b'Every review I see on this birth control is horrible. I&#039;ve had it in for almost 5 maybe 6 months and its been GREAT. I used to have a very heavy period.. Now I&#039;ve only had 2 periods and they was so light all I had to wear was a panty liner. I don&#039;t understand why people say all these bad things? And about the weight gain that was my BIGGEST concern. I weighed 117- 120 before the implant. I&#039;m 17 years old btw. Now I weigh about 109 - 110. So I lost a good couple pounds. And about the mood changes. None from not really having a period anymore my mood has been fantastic. And my sex drive has gone way up because of the difference. I just took my big sis to go get the implant a week or so ago. Getting it put in dose not hurt at all. ITS GREAT!'\n"," b'I wanted to chime in because most of the people writing reviews had bad experiences--I doubt most people who are happy with a drug will go online to write a review. I took Loestrin and Minastrin for several years (bioequivalent to Taytulla), loved them both, switched to Taytulla about a year ago, don&#039;t notice any difference. For me, they are fantastic birth control. The ONLY side effects I have are going from 8 day heavy periods to no periods, no spotting ever, and clearing up the cystic acne I would get during ovulation and my period. Total win for me. I tried many different kinds of OC in my twenties and really didn&#039;t like any of them, so feel so lucky to have found this in my late 30s. Everyone&#039;s body will respond differently.'\n"," b'I had kyleena I inserted 9/1. I was terrified but it wasn&#039;t bad at all. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen before. Insertion wasn&#039;t painful at all. It wasn&#039;t pleasant but it was painful. Lasted maybe 30 seconds. No kids, first IUD I have had. I spotted around the time I should have had my period, now nothing. No acne. A little bit of cramping here and there the first week but I think I just really liked my heating pad.'\n"," b'I took Loestrin 24 FE for five years and loved it! I had no weight gain, hardly any acne or mood swings, and absolutely no cramping. I started taking birth control because I was missing school due to cramps, so this was a significant benefit for me. The two problems are that I frequently missed periods, and that it was extremely expensive due to the absence of a generic. '\n"," b'I just very recently started this birth control, and I was very wary of it at first because my experience with Loestrin Fe was TERRIBLE. But ever since I&#039;ve been on this pill it&#039;s like heaven! Loestrin made me super nauseous, very moody and angry, and completely killed my sex drive. Now that I&#039;m on Minastrin 24 Fe, I feel completely normal! I&#039;ll admit, in the beginning I was slightly moody and I have noticed a slight decrease in sex drive, but nothing too major. Overall I LOVE this birth control and I&#039;m so happy with how it worked out for me!'\n"," b'Didn&#039;t help. Made me feel weird.
